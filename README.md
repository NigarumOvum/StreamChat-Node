# Chat App 

## Description:
> This is a basic chat app made by NodeJS. It uses a real-time bi-directional event-based communication using [Socket.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/socket.io). The app can be simultaneously used within different devices as long as it remains with the same chat room.
